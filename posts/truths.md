I’m not that self motivated. I need a **Job** and a **Boss** and I need to be able to Go Home. I’ve spent my whole life working whenever I was needed, so I’m looking for the equivalent of that in web development. What’s a Tech Job where I can be a dedicated drone? I’ll always be good, not great, because I don’t want to be great. I’d rather spend the energy I’d comsume being great, being outside or reading a good book or gardening, walking in the woods, climbing a mountain. I need a remote job where I can plug in enough here and there to pay for life.  

Quitting my retail job, studying for entrance to, getting accepted at, completing the Full Stack Web Developer course at, and gaining endorsement from Lambda School is the most impressive thing I’ve ever done. Secondly, I can break down a chicken in 20 seconds, and a half hog in about an hour.

An elderly man dropped a small popcorn in the aisle of the movie theater. He left for a refill. I did not clean up every kernel, however I did sweep-kick most of them out of the way of general traffic. I easily extend myself outside of my job/department if it means I can hopefully improve something for someone else, and working in a strong, balanced team means I can take over where my strengths lie and I can surrender or learn where my strengths are lacking.

I think we as a species should go back to eating seasonally. And consume more rabbit, less pig poultry and cow.
